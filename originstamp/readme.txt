OriginStamp is an automated time-stamping solution for your WordPress posts using the OriginStamp API service.

== Description ==


OriginStamp is a web-based, trusted timestamping service that uses the decentralized Bitcoin block chain to store anonymous, tamper-proof time stamps for any digital content.
OriginStamp is free of charge and allows users to prove that they were the originator of certain information at a given point in time.
This plugin embeds our OriginStamp service(http://www.originstamp.org/) as 3rd party service into WordPress. 
Each time you create or modify a new blog entry, an unique fingerprint is calculated.
The original data cannot be guessed from the fingerprint. Therefore only the fingerprint (SHA-256) is submitted to OriginStamp.

To sum up:

1. You can timestamp your post made with WordPress to be able to prove the existence of the information contained in the post in a certain point of time.
2. With a copy of the post title and the post content you can prove to anybody, that you were in possession of this data at a certain point in time.


== Installation ==

= From your WordPress dashboard =

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'
2. Search for 'OriginStamp'
3. Activate OriginStamp from your Plugins page.

= From WordPress.org =

1. Download OriginStamp.
2. Upload the 'originstamp' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, using your favorite method (ftp, sftp, scp, etc...)
3. Activate OriginStamp from your Plugins page.

= Settings =

Visit 'Settings > OriginStamp' and adjust your configuration.

There are two settings fields.
The mandatory api key field is mandatory needs to filled by the key created at https://originstamp.org/dev
This key will be used to send requests to OriginStamp.
An email field that you can enter to obtain a copy of the data that was hashed via email and store it.
Note that your email is only used internally, you will receive email from your WordPress server, not from us.
We do not send the email address elsewhere.
If you do not want to receive any emails, just leave the email field empty.
If you've entered your email address and decide that you do not want to receive email anyway, just delete the email field and hit 'Save changes' at the bottom of the settings page.

The plugin will create a data table in the local WordPress database to store content of posts. If the data table is not created (you will receive an error in the settings page), the plugin won` function properly. In this case you can create this table manually.

If you delete the plugin, the created data table will be removed automatically. So do a backup if you want to keep data stored in it.
