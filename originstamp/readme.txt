OriginStamp is an automated time-stamping solution for your WordPress posts using the OriginStamp API service.

== Description ==

A timestamp is created every time you save a blog post. The created from a concatenation of the plain post title and the post content. All layout and formatting tags are removed from title and post context before. Please visit www.originstamp.org for contact information.

This plugin embeds our OriginStamp (http://www.originstamp.org/) as 3rd party service into WordPress. This service was founded to timestamp research data and publications via the Bitcoin Blockchain.
With this service you can timestamp your post, which would give you following benefits:

1. You can timestamp your pst made with WordPress to be able to prove the existence of the information contained in the post in a certain point of time.
2. With a copy of the post title and the post content you can prove to anybody, that you were in possession of this data at a certain point in time.

Note that your data is only saved in the database of your WordPress installation. The plugin does not send your data anywhere. Only a sha256 value is locally created as a unique fingerprint of your data and sent via an external request to OriginStamp.
OriginStamp stores that unique hash only and forwards it to the Bitcoin network to be stored in the Bitcoin Blockchain.


== Installation ==

= From your WordPress dashboard =

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'
2. Search for 'OriginStamp'
3. Activate OriginStamp from your Plugins page.

= From WordPress.org =

1. Download OriginStamp.
2. Upload the 'originstamp' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, using your favorite method (ftp, sftp, scp, etc...)
3. Activate OriginStamp from your Plugins page.

= Settings =

Visit 'Settings > OriginStamp' and adjust your configuration.

There are two settings fields. An api key field that stores an api key that you can obtain from our service. This key will be used to send requests to OriginStamp.
An email field that you can enter to obtain a copy of the data that was hashed via email and store it. Note that your email is only used internally, you will receive email from your WordPress server, not from us. We do not send the email address anywhere.
If you do not want to receive any emails, just leave the email field empty. If you've entered your email address and decide that you do not want to receive email anyway, just delete the email field and hit 'Save changes' at the bottom of the settings page.

The plugin will create a data table in the local WordPress database to store content of posts. If the data table is not created (you will receive an error in the settings page), the plugin won` function properly. In this case you can create this table manually.

If you delete the plugin, the created data table will be removed automatically. So do a backup if you want to keep data stored in it.
